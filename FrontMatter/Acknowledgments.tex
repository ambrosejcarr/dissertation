Before beginning my PhD, I had never written a single line of code. 
My studies had woven through Neuroscience and Molecular Biology, but my contributions were exclusively made at the lab bench.  
To this day I have no idea what Dana saw in me that suggested that I would be successful in a computational PhD, but I am indebted to her for the patience she has shown and mentoring she has provided. 
Always available to provide advice and right my course when I digressed, these projects would not have been possible without Dana's support, insight, and connections.
Dana made possible the formative edcuational experience of my PhD: visiting Prof. Aviv Regev's group and shadowing now-professors Dr. Rahul Satija and Dr. Alex Shalek, both of whom, through generosity of time and expertise, helped shape my impressions of nascent single-cell sequencing, but also opened my eyes to the open questions, motivating much of the work contained in this dissertation. % todo make this a bit clearer. Dana did more than use her connections to help me find the right people. 

As no experiments can proceed in a vacuum, I am grateful for the insight and criticism provided by my committee members Prof. Harmen Bussemaker and Prof. Peter Sims, and for Prof. Rahul Satija and Prof. Alexander Rudensky, for serving on my defense committee.    
I am also grateful to the Howard Hughes Medical Insitute, who generously funded me during my PhD at Columbia University, and to all of my collaborators: Prof. Peter Sims, Prof. Alexander Rudensky, Prof. Frederic Geissmann, Dr. George Plitas, and Kasia Konnopacki for pushing my research in directions I would not have explored on my own.  
Similarly, I am grateful to Dr. Elham Azizi, Dr. Sandhya Prabhakaran, Andrew Cornish, Dr. Manu Setty, and Kristy Choi for their contributions to these projects and for their insight and friendship, which made coming to work easy.  

% todo fix this, put sharon first.
Not to be forgotten, none of these experiments would be possible if not for the hard work of my tireless wet-lab colleagues: Dr. Linas Mazutis, Juozas Nainys, and Vaidotas Kiseliovas, who carried out all of the sequencing experiments and were instrumental in providing feedback on the computational approaches I developed. 
Finally, thank you to my friends and colleagues [order TBA, lets see who edits my dissertation] .. and to my wife, Sharonmoyee Goswami, and my family, for their support throughout my PhD.
