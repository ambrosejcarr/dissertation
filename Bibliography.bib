  abstract  = {Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs.Science, this issue p. 189To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

  abstract  = {Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs)
               are important regulators of immune responses in cancer and have
               been directly implicated in the promotion of tumor progression.
               However, the heterogeneity of these cells and the lack of
               distinct markers hamper the progress in understanding the
               biology and clinical importance of these cells. Using partial
               enrichment of PMN-MDSC with gradient centrifugation, we
               determined that low-density PMN-MDSC and high-density
               neutrophils from the same cancer patients had a distinct gene
               profile. The most prominent changes were observed in the
               expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
               stress. Unexpectedly, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was one of
               the most increased regulators, and its receptor oxidized LDL
               receptor 1 (OLR1) was one of the most overexpressed genes in
               PMN-MDSC. Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) encoded by
               OLR1 was practically undetectable in neutrophils in peripheral
               blood of healthy donors, whereas 5 to 15\% of total neutrophils
               in cancer patients and 15 to 50\% of neutrophils in tumor
               tissues were LOX-1+. In contrast to their LOX-1− counterparts,
               LOX-1+ neutrophils had gene signature, potent immunosuppressive
               activity, up-regulation of ER stress, and other biochemical
               characteristics of PMN-MDSCs. Moreover, induction of ER stress
               in neutrophils from healthy donors up-regulated LOX-1 expression
               and converted these cells to suppressive PMN-MDSCs. Thus, we
               identified a specific marker of human PMN-MDSC associated with
               ER stress and lipid metabolism, which provides new insights into
               the biology and potential therapeutic targeting of these cells.},

                 heterogeneous cell types form complex organs. Nevertheless,
                 dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations
                 is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively
                 parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for
                 analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of
                 single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification
                 algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type
                 characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell
                 transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional
                 hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity
                 and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen
                 activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through
                 inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than
                 a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data
                 demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective tool for
                 comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.},

  abstract = {The PCK1 gene (Pck1 in rodents) encodes the cytosolic isozyme of
              phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C), which is well-known
              for its function as a gluconeogenic enzyme in the liver and
              kidney. Mouse studies involving whole body and tissue-specific
              Pck1 knockouts as well as tissue-specific over-expression of
              PEPCK-C have resulted in type 2 diabetes as well as several
              surprising phenotypes including obesity, lipodystrophy, fatty
              liver, and death. These phenotypes arise from perturbations not
              only in gluconeogenesis but in two additional metabolic functions
              of PEPCK-C: (1) cataplerosis which maintains metabolic flux
              through the Krebs cycle by removing excess oxaloacetate, and (2)
              glyceroneogenesis which produces glycerol-3-phosphate as a
              precursor for fatty acid esterification into triglycerides.
              PEPCK-C catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate + GTP to
              phosphoenolpyruvate + GDP + CO2. It is in part the
              tissue-specificity of this simple reaction that results in the
              variety of phenotypes listed above. Briefly: (1) A 7-fold
              over-expression of PEPCK-C in the livers of mice causes excessive
              glucose production. (2) Mice with a whole-body knockout of Pck1
              die within 2-3 days of birth, not from hypoglycemia, but probably
              because the Krebs cycle slows to approximately 10\% of normal in
              the absence of cataplerosis. (3) Mice with a liver-specific
              knockout have an inability to remove oxaloacetate from the Krebs
              cycle, which leads to a fatty liver following a fast. (4) An
              adipose-specific knockout of Pck1 results in a fraction of the
              mice developing lipodystrophy due to lost glyceroneogenesis and a
              consequent decrease in fatty acid re-esterification. (5) Finally,
              disregulated over-expression of PEPCK-C in adipose tissue

  abstract    = {The biguanide derivative metformin is a potent anti-diabetic
                 drug widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
                 Its major effect on glucose metabolism consists in the
                 inhibition of hepatic glucose production. Since the mechanisms
                 of metformin action are only partially understood at the
                 molecular level, we studied the regulation of the gene
                 promoter activity of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the
                 central hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme, by this drug. We have
                 found that both metformin and insulin inhibit the basal and
                 dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated G6Pase promoter activity in
                 hepatoma cells. Since one of the pharmacological targets of
                 metformin is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
                 activation of AMPK is known to inhibit hepatic glucose
                 production by the suppression of G6Pase gene transcription, we
                 studied the effect of AMPK in this context. Under
                 nonstimulated conditions, the inhibitory effect of both
                 insulin and metformin was partially counteracted to a similar
                 extent by treatment with compound C, a specific inhibitor of
                 AMPK. In contrast, under conditions of stimulation with
                 dexamethasone and cAMP, treatment with compound C reversed the
                 inhibitory effect of metformin on G6Pase promoter activity to
                 a similar extent as compared to nonstimulated conditions,
                 whereas the effect of insulin was almost resistant to
                 treatment with the AMPK-antagonist. These data indicate a
                 differential AMPK-dependent regulation of G6Pase gene
                 expression by insulin and metformin under basal and
                 dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated conditions.},

  abstract      = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated
                   singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR
                   decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and
                   scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent
                   research which demonstrates that randomization offers a
                   powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation.
                   These techniques exploit modern computational architectures
                   more fully than classical methods and open the possibility
                   of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents
                   a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms
                   that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods
                   use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures
                   most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then
                   compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this
                   subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated
                   deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank
                   factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its
                   classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and
                   robustness. These claims are supported by extensive
                   numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

               datasets to ascertain which genes or molecules distinguish the
               known major subsets of human T cells. Our strategy allowed us to
               identify the genes expressed in most T cell subsets: TCR
               $\alpha$$\beta$+ and $\gamma$$\delta$+, three effector subsets
               (Th1, Th2, and T follicular helper cells), T central memory, T
               effector memory, activated T cells, and others. Our genechip
               dataset also allowed for identification of genes preferentially
               or exclusively expressed by T cells, compared with numerous
               non-T cell leukocyte subsets profiled. Cross-comparisons between
               microarray datasets revealed important features of certain
               subsets. For instance, blood $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells expressed
               no unique gene transcripts, but did differ from $\alpha$$\beta$
               T cells in numerous genes that were down-regulated. Hierarchical
               clustering of all the genes differentially expressed between T
               cell subsets enabled the identification of precise signatures.
               Moreover, the different T cell subsets could be distinguished at

               genes, most of which have not previously been associated

               had the greatest influence on gene regulation, whereas central
               and effector memory T cells displayed surprisingly similar gene

               activation, various effector functions, and immunological

               devastating consequences, such as the development of autoimmune
               diseases. In some cases, however, we may wish to be able to
               break tolerance, for example, to activate immune cells to fight
               tumors. Schietinger et al. (p. [723][1], published online 19
               January; see the Perspective by [Lee and Jameson][2] ) used a
               combination of genetic mouse models and adoptive immune cell
               transfers to better understand the mechanisms regulating
               tolerance in T lymphocytes. In contrast to the prevailing
               paradigm, the maintenance of T lymphocyte tolerance did not
               require the continuous presence of antigen. Tolerance was able
               to be broken when previously tolerized cells were placed in an
               environment depleted of immune cells. However, when lymphocyte
               numbers were restored, cells were once again tolerized, even in
               the absence of antigen. These data, together with gene
               expression profiling, suggest that tolerance is associated with
               a specific gene expression program that, although possible to
               override temporarily, is reimposed by epigenetic mechanisms.

              inflammatory tissue expression of the hypoxia-inducible
              factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), indicating a role of hypoxia-mediated
              signals in regulation of T cell function. Surprisingly,
              accumulation of HIF-1alpha in human T cells required not only

              repressed activation-induced cell death (AICD) by TCR/CD3
              stimulation, resulting in an increased survival of the cells.
              Microarray analysis suggested the involvement of HIF-1 target
              gene product adrenomedullin (AM) in this process. Indeed, AM

                 (SAV; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) have made it more
                 difficult to determine directly the baseline error rate of
                 sequencing runs. To improve our ability to measure base
                 quality, we have created an open-source tool to construct the
                 Percent Perfect Reads (PPR) plot, previously provided by the
                 Illumina sequencers. The PPR program is compatible with HiSeq
                 2000/2500, MiSeq, and NextSeq 500 instruments and provides an
                 alternative to Illumina's quality value (Q) scores for
                 determining run quality. Whereas Q scores are representative
                 of run quality, they are often overestimated and are sourced
                 from different look-up tables for each platform. The PPR's
                 unique capabilities as a cross-instrument comparison device,
                 as a troubleshooting tool, and as a tool for monitoring
                 instrument performance can provide an increase in clarity over
                 SAV metrics that is often crucial for maintaining instrument
                 health. These capabilities are highlighted.},

                 antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects. Because of
                 these important properties, in the past two decades, major
                 research efforts have been undertaken to understand the
                 signalling mechanisms through which these cytokines induce
                 their effects. Since the original discovery of the classical
                 JAK (Janus activated kinase)-STAT (signal transducer and
                 activator of transcription) pathway of signalling, it has
                 become clear that the coordination and cooperation of multiple
                 distinct signalling cascades - including the mitogen-activated
                 protein kinase p38 cascade and the phosphatidylinositol
                 3-kinase cascade - are required for the generation of
                 responses to interferons. It is anticipated that an increased
                 understanding of the contributions of these recently
                 identified pathways will advance our current thinking about
                 how interferons work.},

              (sequence tags) onto individual DNA samples before massively
              parallel sequencing is a popular and efficient way to obtain
              sequence data from many individual samples. Tag sequences should
              be numerous and sufficiently different to ensure sequencing,
              replication, and oligonucleotide synthesis errors do not cause
              tags to be unrecoverable or confused. However, many design
              approaches only protect against substitution errors during
              sequencing and extant tag sets contain too few tag sequences. We
              developed an open-source software package to validate sequence
              tags for conformance to two distance metrics and design sequence
              tags robust to indel and substitution errors. We use this
              software package to evaluate several commercial and
              non-commercial sequence tag sets, design several large sets
              (max(count) = 7,198) of edit metric sequence tags having
              different lengths and degrees of error correction, and integrate
              a subset of these edit metric tags to polymerase chain reaction
              (PCR) primers and sequencing adapters. We validate a subset of
              these edit metric tagged PCR primers and sequencing adapters by
              sequencing on several platforms and subsequent comparison to
              commercially available alternatives. We find that several
              commonly used sets of sequence tags or design methodologies used
              to produce sequence tags do not meet the minimum expectations of
              their underlying distance metric, and we find that PCR primers
              and sequencing adapters incorporating edit metric sequence tags
              designed by our software package perform as well as their
              commercial counterparts. We suggest that researchers evaluate
              sequence tags prior to use or evaluate tags that they have been
              using. The sequence tag sets we design improve on extant sets
              because they are large, valid across the set, and robust to the
              suite of substitution, insertion, and deletion errors affecting
              massively parallel sequencing workflows on all currently used

  abstract    = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data
                 is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
                 non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
                 lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                 technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
                 high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
                 limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large
                 (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
                 developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                 (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
                 alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
                 search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed
                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per
                 hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time
                 improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to
                 unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
                 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
                 transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
                 sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
                 polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally
                 validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
                 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the
                 STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR
                 is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open
                 source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be

                 that annealing plays in efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich
                 templates. The analysis is focused on the annealing of primers
                 at alternative binding sites (competitive annealing) and the
                 main result is a quantitative expression of the efficiency
                 (eta) of annealing as a function of temperature (T(A)),
                 annealing period (t(A)), and template composition. The optimal
                 efficiency lies in a narrow region of T(A) and t(A) for
                 GC-rich templates and a much broader region for normal GC
                 templates. To confirm the theoretical findings, the following
                 genes have been PCR amplified from human cDNA template: ARX
                 and HBB (with 78.72\% and 52.99\% GC, respectively).
                 Theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the
                 experimental findings. Optimum annealing times for GC-rich
                 genes lie in the range of 3-6s and depend on annealing
                 temperature. Annealing times greater than 10s yield smeared
                 PCR amplified products. The non-GC-rich gene did not exhibit
                 this sensitivity to annealing times. Theory and experimental
                 results show that shorter annealing times are not only
                 sufficient but can actually aid in more efficient PCR
                 amplification of GC-rich templates.},

               protect the host. They evolved as a critical barrier against
               infections and are important contributors to tissue remodeling.
               However, in cancer, myeloid cells are largely converted to serve
               a new master---tumor cells. This process is epitomized by
               myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). These cells are closely
               related to neutrophils and monocytes. MDSCs are not present in
               the steady state of healthy individuals and appear in cancer and
               in pathologic conditions associated with chronic inflammation or
               stress. These cells have emerged as an important contributor to
               tumor progression. Ample evidence supports a key role for MDSCs

                 analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells
                 simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin.
                 We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and

  abstract    = {The mediators and cellular effectors of inflammation are
                 important constituents of the local environment of tumours. In
                 some types of cancer, inflammatory conditions are present
                 before a malignant change occurs. Conversely, in other types
                 of cancer, an oncogenic change induces an inflammatory
                 microenvironment that promotes the development of tumours.
                 Regardless of its origin, 'smouldering' inflammation in the
                 tumour microenvironment has many tumour-promoting effects. It
                 aids in the proliferation and survival of malignant cells,
                 promotes angiogenesis and metastasis, subverts adaptive immune
                 responses, and alters responses to hormones and
                 chemotherapeutic agents. The molecular pathways of this
                 cancer-related inflammation are now being unravelled,
                 resulting in the identification of new target molecules that
                 could lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.},

                 considered to be a hallmark of tumor cells. Whether this
                 increase in glycolytic activity is due mainly to inherent
                 metabolic alterations or to the hypoxic microenvironment
                 remains controversial. Here we have transformed human adult
                 mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) using genetic alterations as
                 described for differentiated cells. Our data suggest that MSC
                 require disruption of the same pathways as have been shown for
                 differentiated cells to confer a fully transformed phenotype.
                 Furthermore, we found that MSC are more glycolytic than
                 primary human fibroblasts and, in contrast to differentiated
                 cells, do not depend on increased aerobic glycolysis for ATP
                 production during transformation. These data indicate that
                 aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is not an intrinsic
                 component of the transformation of adult stem cells, and that
                 oncogenic adaptation to bioenergetic requirements, in some
                 circumstances, may also rely on increases in oxidative
                 phosphorylation. We did find, however, a reversible increase
                 in the transcription of glycolytic enzymes in tumors generated
                 by transformed MSC, indicating this is a secondary phenomenon
                 resulting from adaptation of the tumor to its
                 microenvironment.},

              relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab monotherapy (at a dose of 3 mg per
              kilogram of body weight), as compared with glycoprotein 100,
              improved overall survival in a phase 3 study involving patients
              with previously treated metastatic melanoma. We conducted a phase
              3 study of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in
              patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma. METHODS:
              We randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated
              metastatic melanoma, in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per
              kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter of
              body-surface area) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) plus
              placebo, given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by dacarbazine
              alone every 3 weeks through week 22. Patients with stable disease
              or an objective response and no dose-limiting toxic effects
              received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as
              maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.
              RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly longer in the group
              receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving
              dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 months, with higher
              survival rates in the ipilimumab-dacarbazine group at 1 year
              (47.3\% vs. 36.3\%), 2 years (28.5\% vs. 17.9\%), and 3 years
              (20.8\% vs. 12.2\%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001).
              Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3\% of patients
              treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5\%
              treated with dacarbazine and placebo (P<0.001). No drug-related
              deaths or gastrointestinal perforations occurred in the
              ipilimumab-dacarbazine group. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab (at a dose
              of 10 mg per kilogram) in combination with dacarbazine, as
              compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, improved overall survival
              in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma. The
              types of adverse events were consistent with those seen in prior
              studies of ipilimumab; however, the rates of elevated
              liver-function values were higher and the rates of
              gastrointestinal events were lower than expected on the basis of
              prior studies. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb;

                 monitor tissue-, disease- and cell type--specific gene
                 expression, but it has been technically challenging to
                 generate expression profiles from single cells. Here we
                 describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is
                 applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing
                 methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across
                 transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative
                 transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative
                 accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by
                 evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that
                 although gene expression estimates from single cells have
                 increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes
                 could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying
                 Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we

  abstract    = {Novel sequencing technologies permit the rapid production of
                 large sequence data sets. These technologies are likely to
                 revolutionize genetics and biomedical research, but a thorough
                 characterization of the ultra-short read output is necessary.
                 We generated and analyzed two Illumina 1G ultra-short read
                 data sets, i.e. 2.8 million 27mer reads from a Beta vulgaris
                 genomic clone and 12.3 million 36mers from the Helicobacter
                 acinonychis genome. We found that error rates range from 0.3\%
                 at the beginning of reads to 3.8\% at the end of reads. Wrong
                 base calls are frequently preceded by base G. Base
                 substitution error frequencies vary by 10- to 11-fold, with A
                 > C transversion being among the most frequent and C > G
                 transversions among the least frequent substitution errors.
                 Insertions and deletions of single bases occur at very low
                 rates. When simulating re-sequencing we found a 20-fold
                 sequencing coverage to be sufficient to compensate errors by
                 correct reads. The read coverage of the sequenced regions is
                 biased; the highest read density was found in intervals with
                 elevated GC content. High Solexa quality scores are
                 over-optimistic and low scores underestimate the data quality.
                 Our results show different types of biases and ways to detect
                 them. Such biases have implications on the use and
                 interpretation of Solexa data, for de novo sequencing,
                 re-sequencing, the identification of single nucleotide
                 polymorphisms and DNA methylation sites, as well as for
                 transcriptome analysis.},

                 of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS)

                 Computational analysis relates a spectrum of cellular states
                 in vivo to in-vitro-differentiated Th17 cells and unveils
                 genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility.

                 Toso, and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity
                 thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity and can identify

                 conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using
                 image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells,
                 we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript
                 abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic
                 and can be predicted with multivariate models of the
                 phenotypic state and population context of single cells.
                 Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures
                 across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system
                 that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance
                 between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and
                 experimental validation show that nuclear retention and
                 transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm
                 is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional
                 fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates
                 that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional

                 amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating
                 these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following
                 reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is
                 added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely
                 labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both
                 ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read
                 the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the
                 number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number

  abstract = {In vivo GITR ligation has previously been shown to augment
              T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity, yet the underlying
              mechanisms of this activity, particularly its in vivo effects on
              CD4+ foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), have not been fully
              elucidated. In order to translate this immunotherapeutic approach
              to the clinic it is important gain better understanding of its
              mechanism(s) of action. Utilizing the agonist anti-GITR
              monoclonal antibody DTA-1, we found that in vivo GITR ligation
              modulates regulatory T cells (Tregs) directly during induction of
              melanoma tumor immunity. As a monotherapy, DTA-1 induced
              regression of small established B16 melanoma tumors. Although
              DTA-1 did not alter systemic Treg frequencies nor abrogate the
              intrinsic suppressive activity of Tregs within the tumor-draining
              lymph node, intra-tumor Treg accumulation was significantly
              impaired. This resulted in a greater Teff:Treg ratio and enhanced
              tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell activity. The decreased intra-tumor
              Treg accumulation was due both to impaired infiltration, coupled
              with DTA-1-induced loss of foxp3 expression in intra-tumor Tregs.
              Histological analysis of B16 tumors grown in Foxp3-GFP mice
              showed that the majority of GFP+ cells had lost Foxp3 expression.
              These ``unstable'' Tregs were absent in IgG-treated tumors and in
              DTA-1 treated TDLN, demonstrating a tumor-specific effect.
              Impairment of Treg infiltration was lost if Tregs were GITR(-/-),
              and the protective effects of DTA-1 were reduced in reconstituted
              RAG1(-/-) mice if either the Treg or Teff subset were
              GITR-negative and absent if both were negative. Our results
              demonstrate that DTA-1 modulates both Teffs and Tregs during
              effective tumor treatment. The data suggest that DTA-1 prevents
              intra-tumor Treg accumulation by altering their stability, and as
              a result of the loss of foxp3 expression, may modify their
              intra-tumor suppressive capacity. These findings provide further
              support for the continued development of agonist anti-GITR mAbs
              as an immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer.},

              tolerability of anti-PD-1 blockade in patients with
              treatment-refractory solid tumors and to preliminarily assess
              antitumor activity, pharmacodynamics, and immunologic correlates.
              PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with advanced
              metastatic melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant
              prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal
              cell carcinoma (RCC) received a single intravenous infusion of
              anti-PD-1 (MDX-1106) in dose-escalating six-patient cohorts at
              0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, followed by a 15-patient expansion cohort
              at 10 mg/kg. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit at 3
              months were eligible for repeated therapy. RESULTS: Anti-PD-1 was
              well tolerated: one serious adverse event, inflammatory colitis,
              was observed in a patient with melanoma who received five doses
              at 1 mg/kg. One durable complete response (CRC) and two partial
              responses (PRs; melanoma, RCC) were seen. Two additional patients
              (melanoma, NSCLC) had significant lesional tumor regressions not
              meeting PR criteria. The serum half-life of anti-PD-1 was 12 to
              20 days. However, pharmacodynamics indicated a sustained mean
              occupancy of > 70\% of PD-1 molecules on circulating T cells > or
              = 2 months following infusion, regardless of dose. In nine
              patients examined, tumor cell surface B7-H1 expression appeared
              to correlate with the likelihood of response to treatment.
              CONCLUSION: Blocking the PD-1 immune checkpoint with intermittent
              antibody dosing is well tolerated and associated with evidence of
              antitumor activity. Exploration of alternative dosing regimens
              and combinatorial therapies with vaccines, targeted therapies,
              and/or other checkpoint inhibitors is warranted.},

  abstract    = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of
                 transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of
                 systems biology, enabled by the advent of DNA microarrays.
                 While this approach has literally transformed our vision and
                 approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has
                 always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori,
                 what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density
                 tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler
                 organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex,
                 eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of
                 ``next-generation'' massively parallel sequencing (MPS)
                 technologies by companies such as Roche (454 GS FLX), Illumina
                 (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB SOLiD) has completely
                 transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can
                 be done. These new technologies have reduced both the
                 cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude,
                 making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many
                 experimental approaches. One such method that has recently
                 been developed uses MPS technology to directly survey the RNA
                 content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional
                 cloning associated with EST sequencing. This approach, called
                 ``RNA-seq'', can generate quantitative expression scores that
                 are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the
                 entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a
                 priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important
                 advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative
                 expression measures be made, but transcript structures
                 including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also
                 be identified. This article discusses the experimental
                 approach for both sample preparation and data analysis for the
                 technique of RNA-seq.},

  abstract    = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have
                 been found to express different numbers of molecules of
                 specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these
                 variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules
                 of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably
                 integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are
                 massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in
                 each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are
                 synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription
                 beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an
                 active state and ending when they transition back to the
                 inactive state. We show that these transitions are
                 intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors
                 such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover,
                 the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes
                 within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are
                 also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts
                 of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by
                 slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene
                 activation and inactivation was developed to explain the
                 statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that
                 increasing the level of transcription factors increases the
                 average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These
                 results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is
                 subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise
                 questions about how cells are able to function in the face of
                 such noise.},

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing technology provides us
                 unprecedented opportunities to study transcriptome dynamics.
                 Compared to microarray-based gene expression profiling,
                 RNA-Seq has many advantages, such as high resolution, low
                 background, and ability to identify novel transcripts.
                 Moreover, for genes with multiple isoforms, expression of each
                 isoform may be estimated from RNA-Seq data. Despite these
                 advantages, recent work revealed that base level read counts
                 from RNA-Seq data may not be randomly distributed and can be
                 affected by local nucleotide composition. It was not clear
                 though how the base level read count bias may affect gene
                 level expression estimates. RESULTS: In this paper, by using
                 five published RNA-Seq data sets from different biological
                 sources and with different data preprocessing schemes, we
                 showed that commonly used estimates of gene expression levels
                 from RNA-Seq data, such as reads per kilobase of gene length
                 per million reads (RPKM), are biased in terms of gene length,
                 GC content and dinucleotide frequencies. We directly examined
                 the biases at the gene-level, and proposed a simple
                 generalized-additive-model based approach to correct different
                 sources of biases simultaneously. Compared to previously
                 proposed base level correction methods, our method reduces
                 bias in gene-level expression estimates more effectively.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Our method identifies and corrects different
                 sources of biases in gene-level expression measures from
                 RNA-Seq data, and provides more accurate estimates of gene
                 expression levels from RNA-Seq. This method should prove
                 useful in meta-analysis of gene expression levels using
                 different platforms or experimental protocols.},

                 tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression
                 analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and
                 expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression
                 patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a
                 novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell
                 RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to
                 form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data
                 were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels
                 of organization: the whole population of cells, the
                 functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the
                 single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to
                 classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was
                 demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: In patients with melanoma, ipilimumab (an antibody
                 against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4])
                 prolongs overall survival, and nivolumab (an antibody against
                 the programmed death 1 [PD-1] receptor) produced durable tumor
                 regression in a phase 1 trial. On the basis of their distinct
                 immunologic mechanisms of action and supportive preclinical
                 data, we conducted a phase 1 trial of nivolumab combined with
                 ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: We
                 administered intravenous doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab in
                 patients every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab
                 alone every 3 weeks for 4 doses (concurrent regimen). The
                 combined treatment was subsequently administered every 12
                 weeks for up to 8 doses. In a sequenced regimen, patients
                 previously treated with ipilimumab received nivolumab every 2
                 weeks for up to 48 doses. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients
                 received concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, and
                 33 received sequenced treatment. The objective-response rate
                 (according to modified World Health Organization criteria) for
                 all patients in the concurrent-regimen group was 40\%.
                 Evidence of clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, or
                 immune-related response or stable disease for $\geq$24 weeks)
                 was observed in 65\% of patients. At the maximum doses that
                 were associated with an acceptable level of adverse events
                 (nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight and
                 ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram), 53\% of patients
                 had an objective response, all with tumor reduction of 80\% or
                 more. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to therapy occurred
                 in 53\% of patients in the concurrent-regimen group but were
                 qualitatively similar to previous experience with monotherapy
                 and were generally reversible. Among patients in the
                 sequenced-regimen group, 18\% had grade 3 or 4 adverse events
                 related to therapy and the objective-response rate was 20\%.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab
                 had a manageable safety profile and provided clinical activity
                 that appears to be distinct from that in published data on
                 monotherapy, with rapid and deep tumor regression in a
                 substantial proportion of patients. (Funded by Bristol-Myers

  abstract    = {Cytoplasmic mRNA movements ultimately determine the spatial
                 distribution of protein synthesis. Although some mRNAs are
                 compartmentalized in cytoplasmic regions, most mRNAs, such as
                 housekeeping mRNAs or the poly-adenylated mRNA population, are
                 believed to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The
                 general mechanism by which all mRNAs may move, and how this
                 may be related to localization, is unknown. Here, we report a
                 method to visualize single mRNA molecules in living mammalian
                 cells, and we report that, regardless of any specific
                 cytoplasmic distribution, individual mRNA molecules exhibit
                 rapid and directional movements on microtubules. Importantly,
                 the beta-actin mRNA zipcode increased both the frequency and
                 length of these movements, providing a common mechanistic
                 basis for both localized and nonlocalized mRNAs. Disruption of
                 the cytoskeleton with drugs showed that microtubules and
                 microfilaments are involved in the types of mRNA movements we
                 have observed, which included complete immobility and
                 corralled and nonrestricted diffusion. Individual mRNA
                 molecules switched frequently among these movements,
                 suggesting that mRNAs undergo continuous cycles of anchoring,
                 diffusion, and active transport.},

  abstract = {Summary Active, but dysfunctional, immune responses in patients
              with cancer have been studied in several tumour types, but owing
              to the heterogeneity of cancer theories of common reaction
              mechanisms seem to be obsolete. In this Review of published
              clinical studies of patients with cancer, expression and
              interplay of the following cytokines are examined: interleukin 2,
              interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 12,
              interleukin 18, tumour necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$),
              transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$),
              interferon-$\gamma$, HLA-DR, macrophage migration inhibitory
              factor (MIF), and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4).
              Clinical data were analysed in a non-quantitative descriptive
              manner and interpreted with regard to experimentally established
              physiological cytokine interactions. The clinical cytokine
              pattern that emerged suggests that simultaneous immunostimulation
              and immunosuppression occur in patients with cancer, with
              increased concentrations of the cytokines MIF, TNF$\alpha$,
              interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 18, and
              TGF$\beta$. This specific cytokine pattern seems to have a
              prognostic effect, since high interleukin 6 or interleukin 10
              serum concentrations are associated with negative prognoses in
              independent cancer types. Although immunostimulatory cytokines
              are involved in local cancer-associated inflammation, cancer
              cells seem to be protected from immunological eradication by
              cytokine-mediated local immunosuppression and a resulting defect
              of the interleukin 12--interferon-$\gamma$--HLA-DR axis.
              Cytokines produced by tumours might have a pivotal role in this
              defect. A working hypothesis is that the cancer-specific and
              histology-independent uniform cytokine cascade is one of the
              manifestations of the underlying paraneoplastic systemic disease,
              and this hypothesis links the stage of cancer with both the
              functional status of the immune system and the patient's
              prognosis. Neutralisation of this cytokine pattern could offer
              novel and so far unexploited treatment approaches for cancer.},

                 dynamics of interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling in a population of
                 T cells during an immune response by combining in silico
                 modeling and single-cell measurements in vitro. We demonstrate
                 that IL-2 receptor expression levels vary widely among T cells

                 cells to consume, produce and participate in IL-2 signaling
                 within the population. Our model reveals that at the
                 population level, these heterogeneous cells are engaged in a
                 tug-of-war for IL-2 between regulatory (T(reg)) and effector

              extremely rare in mammals. Here, to explore the extent of mRNA

              transcript imaging in mouse beta cells, liver, and gut. We
              identify a wide range of protein-coding genes for which the
              levels of spliced polyadenylated mRNA are higher in the nucleus
              than in the cytoplasm. These include genes such as the
              transcription factor ChREBP, Nlrp6, Glucokinase, and Glucagon

  abstract    = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived
                 from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can
                 exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein
                 levels and phenotypic output, with important functional
                 consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity,
                 however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs
                 or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods
                 could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here
                 we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity
                 in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and
                 previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA
                 abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by
                 RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts.
                 In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally
                 expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are
                 very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover,
                 splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of
                 heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality
                 can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known
                 maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences
                 in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we
                 identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated,
                 antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we
                 show that variability in this module may be propagated through
                 an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional
                 regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power
                 and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional
                 diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and
                 circuits.},

  abstract = {Differentiation of na{\"\i}ve CD4+ T cells into functionally
              distinct T helper subsets is crucial for the orchestration of
              immune responses. Due to extensive heterogeneity and multiple
              overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell
              populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic
              dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and
              computational analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian
              processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the
              developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cells during
              blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality
              using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated that
              Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and
              single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression
              was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a T-cell
              intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1
              differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular
              relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in this
              infection. Th1 and Tfh fates emerged from a highly proliferative
              precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated
              cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene
              expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted
              roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In particular, we
              found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not
              a Tfh fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating
              genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two
              unique resources, a database www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates
              discovery of novel factors controlling Th1/Tfh fate commitment,
              and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for
              characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.},

                 cells at the molecular level beyond the more common
                 morphological and transmitter/receptor classifications. The
                 RNA from defined single cells is amplified by microinjecting
                 primer, nucleotides, and enzyme into acutely dissociated cells
                 from a defined region of rat brain. Further processing yields
                 amplified antisense RNA. A second round of amplification
                 results in greater than 10(6)-fold amplification of the
                 original starting material, which is adequate for
                 analysis--e.g., use as a probe, making of cDNA libraries, etc.
                 We demonstrate this method by constructing expression profiles
                 of single live cells from rat hippocampus. This profiling
                 suggests that cells that appear to be morphologically similar
                 may show marked differences in patterns of expression. In
                 addition, we characterize several mRNAs from a single cell,
                 some of which were previously undescribed, perhaps due to
                 ``rarity'' when averaged over many cell types.
                 Electrophysiological analysis coupled with molecular biology
                 within the same cell will facilitate a better understanding of
                 how changes at the molecular level are manifested in
                 functional properties. This approach should be applicable to a
                 wide variety of studies, including development, mutant models,

                 with anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have suggested both
                 positive and negative roles for CTLA-4 in T cell activation.
                 To elucidate the in vivo function of CTLA-4, we generated

                 with metastatic melanoma has been an elusive goal. In this
                 phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic
                 T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor
                 T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein
                 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in
                 patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. METHODS:
                 A total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable
                 stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while
                 they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were
                 randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab
                 plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100
                 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of
                 body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3
                 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients
                 could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was
                 overall survival. RESULTS: The median overall survival was
                 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as
                 compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone
                 (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall
                 survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio
                 for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003).
                 No difference in overall survival was detected between the
                 ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100,
                 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events
                 occurred in 10 to 15\% of patients treated with ipilimumab and
                 in 3\% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related
                 to the study drugs (2.1\%), and 7 were associated with
                 immune-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab, with
                 or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100
                 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously
                 treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe,
                 long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with
                 appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers

  abstract    = {The importance of the immune system in conferring protection
                 against pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and parasitic worms
                 is well established. In contrast, there is a long-lasting
                 debate on whether cancer prevention is a primary function of
                 the immune system. The concept of immunological surveillance
                 of cancer was developed by Lewis Thomas and Frank Macfarlane
                 Burnet more than 50 years ago. We are still lacking convincing
                 data illustrating immunological eradication of precancerous
                 lesions in vivo. Here, I present eight types of evidence in
                 support of the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis. First,
                 primary immunodeficiency in mice and humans is associated with
                 increased cancer risk. Second, organ transplant recipients,
                 who are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, are more prone
                 to cancer development. Third, acquired immunodeficiency due to
                 infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) leads to
                 elevated risk of cancer. Fourth, the quantity and quality of
                 the immune cell infiltrate found in human primary tumors
                 represent an independent prognostic factor for patient
                 survival. Fifth, cancer cells harbor mutations in
                 protein-coding genes that are specifically recognized by the
                 adaptive immune system. Sixth, cancer cells selectively
                 accumulate mutations to evade immune destruction
                 (``immunoediting''). Seventh, lymphocytes bearing the NKG2D
                 receptor are able to recognize and eliminate stressed
                 premalignant cells. Eighth, a promising strategy to treat
                 cancer consists in potentiating the naturally occurring immune
                 response of the patient, through blockade of the immune
                 checkpoint molecules CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1. Thus, there are
                 compelling pieces of evidence that a primary function of the
                 immune system is to confer protection against cancer.},

              and clinical manifestations of autoimmunity. We assessed the
              prognostic significance of autoimmunity in patients with stage
              IIB, IIC, or III melanoma who were treated with high-dose
              adjuvant interferon alfa-2b. METHODS: We enrolled 200 patients in
              a substudy of a larger, ongoing randomized trial. Blood was
              obtained before the initiation of intravenous interferon therapy,
              after 1 month of therapy, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Serum
              was tested for antithyroid, antinuclear, anti-DNA, and
              anticardiolipin autoantibodies, and patients were examined for
              vitiligo. RESULTS: The median duration of follow-up was 45.6
              months. Relapse occurred in 115 patients, and 82 patients died.
              The median relapse-free survival was 28.0 months, and the median
              overall survival was 58.7 months. Autoantibodies and clinical
              manifestations of autoimmunity were detected in 52 patients (26
              percent). The median relapse-free survival was 16.0 months among
              patients without autoimmunity (108 of 148 had a relapse) and was
              not reached among patients with autoimmunity (7 of 52 had a
              relapse). The median survival was 37.6 months among patients
              without autoimmunity (80 of 148 died) and was not reached among
              patients with autoimmunity (2 of 52 died). In univariate and
              multivariate regression analyses, autoimmunity was an independent
              prognostic marker for improved relapse-free survival and overall
              survival (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of autoantibodies

                 elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the
                 Cancer-Immunity Cycle, which manages the delicate balance
                 between the recognition of nonself and the prevention of
                 autoimmunity. Identification of cancer cell T cell inhibitory
                 signals, including PD-L1, has prompted the development of a
                 new class of cancer immunotherapy that specifically hinders
                 immune effector inhibition, reinvigorating and potentially
                 expanding preexisting anticancer immune responses. The
                 presence of suppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment
                 may explain the limited activity observed with previous
                 immune-based therapies and why these therapies may be more
                 effective in combination with agents that target other steps

              mediated by T cells. It has been shown that there is an increased
              proportion of T regs in several different human malignancies,
              although the actual mechanism remains unclear. In the present
              study, we evaluated the prevalence of CD4(+)CD25high T regs in
              PBMCs from patients with gastric and esophageal cancers in
              relation to the clinical outcome. METHODS: PBMCs in 72 patients
              with gastric cancer and 42 patients with esophageal cancer were
              evaluated for the proportion of CD4(+)CD25high T cells, as a
              percentage of the total CD4(+) cells, by flow cytometric analysis
              with triple-color staining. Actuarial overall survival rates of
              the patients were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:
              The percentages of CD4(+)CD25high T cells for cases of gastric
              cancer (4.9+/-1.2\%) and esophageal cancer (5.2+/-2.1\%) were
              significantly higher than those for healthy donors (1.9+/-1.1\%,
              P<0.01). There were significant differences in the prevalence of
              CD4(+)CD25high T cells between the early and advanced disease
              stages, both in gastric cancer (stage I vs. III, P<0.05; stage I
              vs. IV, P<0.05) and esophageal cancer (stage I vs. IV, P<0.05).
              The patients with a high proportion of CD4(+)CD25high T cells
              showed poorer survival rates in comparison to those with a low
              proportion, in both gastric and esophageal cancers. After
              patients received curative resections of gastric cancers (n=57),
              the increased proportions of CD4(+)CD25high T cells were
              significantly reduced, and the levels were almost equal to those
              in normal healthy donors. In addition, studies of gastric cancer
              patients with postoperative recurrent tumors (n=6) revealed that
              the prevalence of CD4(+)CD25high T cells individually increased
              compared to 2 months after the operations. CD4(+)CD25high T cells
              expressed FOXP3 mRNA and had abundant CD45RO and intracellular
              CTLA-4 molecules. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest
              that tumor-related factors induce and expand CD4(+)CD25high T
              regs.},

                 approach for understanding the extent, basis and function of
                 gene expression variation between seemingly identical cells.
                 Here we sequence single-cell RNA-seq libraries prepared from
                 over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial
                 variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in
                 both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given
                 messenger RNA and the transcript's level within expressing
                 cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different
                 temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a 'core'
                 module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few
                 'precocious' cells in response to uniform stimulation with a
                 pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By
                 stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic
                 chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and
                 modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show
                 that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated
                 paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably,
                 preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially
                 reduces variability between cells in the expression of an
                 early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that
                 paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the
                 inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of
                 cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular
                 heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that
                 multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic

                 destination of the mRNA transport remain to be identified.
                 RESULTS: We have developed a system to label mRNA in living
                 yeast with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and follow the
                 dynamics of mRNA movement and localization. Constitutively
                 expressing an ASH1 mRNA containing the bacteriophage MS2
                 coat-protein binding site adjacent to the ASH1 3' UTR allowed
                 us to visualize ASH1 mRNA with an MS2-coat-protein-GFP fusion
                 protein (together denoted 'gRNAASH1'). The gRNAASH1 was
                 restricted to the bud tip in small to large budded cells,
                 migrated to the bud neck prior to cell separation and then
                 rapidly relocalized to the incipient site of bud growth. It
                 also localized to regions of polarized growth during mating.
                 In cells lacking Bud6p/Aip3p or Bnilp/She5p, which are
                 involved in polarity establishment and actin organization,
                 gRNAASH1 migrated to the bud but failed to remain at the bud
                 tip. These studies reveal discrete transport and anchoring
                 steps in mRNA localization. CONCLUSIONS: The ASH1 mRNA was
                 maintained at sites of polarized growth throughout the
                 vegetative and mating cell cycles. Bud6p/Aip3p and Bni1p/She5p
                 are required to maintain the transcript at the cortical bud
                 cap.},

                 distinct phenotypes, genotypes, and epigenetic states, but
                 current models do not adequately reflect tumor composition in
                 patients. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to
                 profile 430 cells from five primary glioblastomas, which we

                 transcriptional programs related to oncogenic signaling,
                 proliferation, complement/immune response, and hypoxia. We
                 also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression
                 states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of

                 requires induction of a strong long-lasting antitumor T-cell
                 response. However, generation of tumor-specific effector T
                 cells does not necessarily result in tumor clearance. CTL must
                 first be able to migrate to the tumor site, infiltrate the
                 tumor tissue, and interact with the target to finally trigger
                 effector functions indispensable for tumor destruction.
                 Chemokines are involved in circulation, homing, retention, and
                 activation of immunocompetent cells. Although some of them are
                 known to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, others are
                 responsible for changes in the tumor microenvironment that
                 lead to extensive infiltration of lymphocytes, resulting in
                 tumor eradication. Given their chemoattractive and activating
                 properties, a role for chemokines in the development of the
                 effector phase of the antitumor immune response has been
                 suggested. Here, we emphasize the role of the
                 chemokine-chemokine receptor network at multiple levels of the
                 T-cell-mediated antitumor immune response. The identification
                 of chemokine-dependent molecular mechanisms implicated in
                 tumor-specific CTL trafficking, retention, and regulation of
                 their in situ effector functions may offer new perspectives
                 for development of innovative immunotherapeutic approaches to

                 cells can activate antitumor immune responses, resulting in
                 the most promising therapeutic approaches, particularly in
                 bladder cancer, currently able to extend patient survival.
                 Thanks to their ability to cross-present antigens to T cells,
                 dendritic cells (DCs) are an immune cell population that plays
                 a central role in the generation of effective antitumor T-cell
                 responses. While IR function and expression have been
                 investigated in T cells, very few data are available for DCs.
                 Therefore, we analyzed whether DCs express IRs that can
                 decrease their functions. To this end, we investigated several
                 IRs (PD-1, CTLA-4, BTLA, TIM-3, and CD160) in circulating
                 CD1c+ DCs, CD141+ DCs, and plasmacytoid DCs from healthy
                 donors and patients with urothelial cancer (UCa). Different DC
                 subsets expressed BTLA and TIM-3 but not other IRs. More
                 importantly, BTLA and TIM-3 were significantly upregulated in
                 DCs from blood of UCa patients. Locally, bladder
                 tumor-infiltrating DCs also overexpressed BTLA and TIM-3
                 compared to DCs from paired nontumoral tissue. Finally, in
                 vitro functional experiments showed that ligand-mediated
                 engagement of BTLA and TIM-3 receptors significantly reduced
                 the secretion of effector cytokines by DC subpopulations. Our
                 findings demonstrate that UCa induces local and systemic
                 overexpression of BTLA and TIM-3 by DCs that may result in
                 their functional inhibition, highlighting these receptors as
                 potential targets for UCa treatment. PATIENT SUMMARY: We
                 investigated the expression and function of a panel of
                 inhibitory receptors in dendritic cells (DCs), an immune cell
                 subpopulation critical in initiation of protective immune
                 responses, among patients with urothelial carcinoma. We found
                 high expression of BTLA and TIM-3 by blood and tumor DCs,
                 which could potentially mediate decreased DC function. The
                 results suggest that BTLA and TIM-3 might be new targets for
                 urothelial carcinoma treatment.},

  abstract = {The A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) has been shown to be a critical
              and nonredundant negative regulator of immune cells in protecting
              normal tissues from inflammatory damage. We hypothesized that
              A2AR also protects cancerous tissues by inhibiting incoming
              antitumor T lymphocytes. Here we confirm this hypothesis by
              showing that genetic deletion of A2AR in the host resulted in
              rejection of established immunogenic tumors in approximately 60\%
              of A2AR-deficient mice with no rejection observed in control WT
              mice. The use of antagonists, including caffeine, or targeting
              the A2 receptors by siRNA pretreatment of T cells improved the
              inhibition of tumor growth, destruction of metastases, and
              prevention of neovascularization by antitumor T cells. The data
              suggest that effects of A2AR are T cell autonomous. The
              inhibition of antitumor T cells via their A2AR in the
              adenosine-rich tumor microenvironment may explain the paradoxical
              coexistence of tumors and antitumor immune cells in some cancer
              patients (the ``Hellstrom paradox''). We propose to target the
              hypoxia-->adenosine-->A2AR pathway as a cancer immunotherapy
              strategy to prevent the inhibition of antitumor T cells in the
              tumor microenvironment. The same strategy may prevent the
              premature termination of immune response and improve the
              vaccine-induced development of antitumor and antiviral T cells.
              The observations of autoimmunity during melanoma rejection in
              A2AR-deficient mice suggest that A2AR in T cells is also
              important in preventing autoimmunity. Thus, although using the
              hypoxia-->adenosine-->A2AR pathway inhibitors may improve
              antitumor immunity, the recruitment of this pathway by selective
              drugs is expected to attenuate the autoimmune tissue damage.},

              Because cell fate choices are executed at the individual cell
              level, new single-cell profiling technologies offer exciting
              possibilities for mapping the dynamic molecular changes
              underlying HSPC differentiation. Here, we have used single-cell
              RNA sequencing to profile more than 1600 single HSPCs, and deep
              sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6558
              protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with
              broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells
              to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing
              intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We
              further show that independently generated single-cell data sets
              can be projected onto the single-cell resolution expression map
              to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and

              early lymphoid, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage

              general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher
              expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active
              maintenance of the stem-cell state. Finally, we report the

              of major adhesion molecules, but was associated with a defect in
              ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 clustering at the EC surface. We also found
              that overexpression of the caveolar structural protein,
              caveolin-1, overcame the VEGF-mediated inhibition of adhesion and
              restored ICAM-1 clustering. Conversely, EC transduction with a
              caveolin-1 small interfering RNA reduced the TNF-alpha-dependent
              increase in adhesion. Finally, we identified VEGF-induced NO
              production by the endothelial NO synthase as the main target of
              the changes in caveolin-1 abundance. We found that the NO
              synthase inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester could reverse
              the inhibitory effects of VEGF on lymphocyte adhesion and EC
              cytoskeleton rearrangement. Symmetrically, a NO donor was shown
              to prevent the ICAM clustering-mediated lymphocyte adhesion,
              thereby recapitulating the effects of VEGF. In conclusion, this
              study provides new insights on the mechanisms leading to the
              tumor EC anergy vs immune cells and opens new perspectives for
              the use of antiangiogenic strategies as adjuvant approaches to
              cancer immunotherapy.},

              maintain self-tolerance and suppress autoimmune diseases such as
              type 1 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition
              to their effects on T cells, T reg cells are essential for
              maintaining normal numbers of dendritic cells (DCs): when T reg
              cells are depleted, there is a compensatory Flt3-dependent
              increase in DCs. However, little is known about how T reg cell
              homeostasis is maintained in vivo. We demonstrate the existence
              of a feedback regulatory loop between DCs and T reg cells. We
              find that loss of DCs leads to a loss of T reg cells, and that
              the remaining T reg cells exhibit decreased Foxp3 expression. The
              DC-dependent loss in T reg cells leads to an increase in the
              number of T cells producing inflammatory cytokines, such as
              interferon gamma and interleukin 17. Conversely, increasing the
              number of DCs leads to increased T reg cell division and
              accumulation by a mechanism that requires major
              histocompatibility complex II expression on DCs. The increase in
              T reg cells induced by DC expansion is sufficient to prevent type
              1 autoimmune diabetes and IBD, which suggests that interference
              with this feedback loop will create new opportunities for
              immune-based therapies.},

                 initiated through the recognition of pathogen-derived
                 molecules by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on
                 both immune and non-immune cells. The initial wave of
                 pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines limits pathogen
                 spread and recruits and activates immune cells to eradicate
                 the invaders. Dendritic cells (DCs) are responsible for
                 initiating a subsequent phase of immunity, dominated by the
                 action of pathogen-specific T and B cells. As for the early
                 pro-inflammatory response, DC activation is triggered by PRR
                 signals. These signals convert resting DCs into potent
                 antigen-presenting cells capable of promoting the expansion
                 and effector differentiation of naive pathogen-specific T
                 cells. However, it has been argued that signals from PRRs are
                 not a prerequisite for DC activation and that pro-inflammatory
                 cytokines have the same effect. Although this may appear like
                 an efficient way to expand the number of DCs that initiate
                 adaptive immunity, evidence is accumulating that DCs activated
                 indirectly by inflammatory cytokines are unable to induce
                 functional T-cell responses. Here, we review the differences
                 between PRR-triggered and cytokine-induced DC activation and
                 speculate on a potential role for DCs activated by
                 inflammatory signals in tolerance induction rather than
                 immunity.},

              Recent reports suggest that the aberrant expression of PD-Ls on
              tumor cells impairs antitumor immunity, resulting in the immune
              evasion of the tumor cells. Although an inverse correlation
              between the expression level of PD-Ls and patients' prognosis has
              been reported for several malignant tumors, the follow-up period
              was limited because of the lack of the antibody (Ab) applicable
              to paraffin-embedded specimens. Here we generated a new Ab
              against PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and analyzed the expression level
              of PD-Ls in human ovarian cancer using paraffin-embedded
              specimens. Patients with higher expression of PD-L1 had a
              significantly poorer prognosis than patients with lower
              expression. Although patients with higher expression of PD-1
              ligand 2 also had a poorer prognosis, the difference was not
              statistically significant. A significant inverse correlation was
              observed between PD-L1 expression and the intraepithelial CD8(+)
              T lymphocyte count, suggesting that PD-L1 on tumor cells directly
              suppresses antitumor CD8(+) T cells. Multivariate analysis showed
              the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and intraepithelial CD8(+)
              T lymphocyte count are independent prognostic factors. The
              PD-1/PD-L pathway can be a good target for restoring antitumor

                 cancer, however, currently there are no biomarkers that
                 predict response to bevacizumab and it is unknown how it
                 influences the immune system in colorectal cancer patients.
                 Dendritic cells are important for the induction of an
                 antitumor immune response; however tumors are capable of
                 disabling dendritic cells and escaping immune surveillance.
                 The aim of this study was to assess the numbers of CD11c+
                 cells infiltrating tumor tissue and to examine the effects of
                 tumor conditioned media (TCM) and bevacizumab conditioned
                 media (BCM) on dendritic cell maturation and correlate our
                 findings with patient survival. colorectal cancer explant
                 tissues were cultured with or without bevacizumab, to generate
                 BCM and TCM, which were used to treat dendritic cells. CD80,
                 CD86, CD83, CD54, HLA-DR, and CD1d expression was measured by
                 flow cytometry. Interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p70 were measured
                 by ELISA. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
                 associate survival with dendritic cell inhibition. TCM and BCM
                 inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced dendritic cell
                 maturation and IL-12p70 secretion (P < 0.0001), while
                 increasing IL-10 secretion (P = 0.0033 and 0.0220,
                 respectively). Inhibition of LPS-induced CD1d (P = 0.021, HR =
                 1.096) and CD83 (P = 0.017, HR = 1.083) by TCM and inhibition
                 of CD1d (P = 0.017, HR = 1.067), CD83 (P = 0.032, HR = 1.035),
                 and IL-12p70 (P = 0.037, HR = 1.036) by BCM was associated
                 with poor survival in colorectal cancer patients. CD11c
                 expression was elevated in tumor tissue compared with normal
                 tissue (P < 0.001), but this did not correlate with survival.
                 In conclusion, TCM and BCM inhibit dendritic cells, and this
                 inhibition correlates with survival of colorectal cancer
                 patients receiving bevacizumab.},
